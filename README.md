# Pratyaksh Suri - Data Scientist and Developer

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, experiences, and achievements in the field of data science and development.

## About Me
I'm Pratyaksh Suri, a passionate and driven data scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to complete a transformative 6-month internship at Mfilterit, an IT company in Noida, where I closely collaborated with the R&D team, specifically in the data science department. With a solid background in computer science and proficiency in key programming languages like Python, C++, and SQL, I'm well-equipped to tackle complex technical challenges. My eagerness to apply this knowledge, collaborate with diverse teams, and contribute to innovative software solutions defines my professional identity.
